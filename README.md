# Miscellaneous RF front-end circuits
## wififem
This is a 2.4 GHz TX and RX amplifier using a SE2611T WiFi front-end chip.
It is intended to go between a LimeSDR and an antenna or a higher-powered
WiFi booster amplifier.

It also includes TX/RX switching controlled by a power detector.

SE2611T was chosen because Tommi OH1GJV had several of them as surplus.
The design hasn't been tested though, since the components and boards got lost
somewhere.
